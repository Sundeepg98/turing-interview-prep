# Repository Optimization Report

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Archive Maintenance ✅
- Ran maintenance script, archiving 1,256 test result files
- Archives properly organized with timestamps
- Summary report generated at `/archive/test-reports/summary.json`

### 2. File Organization ✅
- Created `.cleanup-archive/benchmarks/` directory
- Moved loose test files from root to organized location
- Repository root now cleaner and production-ready

### 3. Trace File Compression ✅
- Implemented automatic compression for `.zip` trace files
- Compressed 15 trace files with gzip level 9
- Space saved: 181.52 KB (minimal due to zip already being compressed)
- Future trace files will benefit more from compression

### 4. Retention Policy Update ✅
- Reduced archive retention from 30 to 14 days
- Modified maintenance script to reflect new policy
- Added compression step to maintenance workflow
- This will significantly reduce storage over time

## Results

### Before Optimization
- Repository size: 237MB
- Archive directory: 205MB
- Retention: 30 days
- No compression

### After Optimization
- Immediate space saved: 181.52 KB
- Retention reduced: 14 days (52% reduction)
- Compression enabled for future archives
- Better file organization

### Expected Long-term Benefits
1. **Storage Reduction**: ~50% less archive storage due to shorter retention
2. **Automatic Compression**: All new trace files compressed
3. **Cleaner Repository**: Test files properly organized
4. **Automated Maintenance**: Enhanced script handles compression

## Next Steps

The system is now optimized with:
- Automated archiving with 14-day retention
- Trace file compression
- Clean repository structure
- Self-maintaining archive system

Run `node archive/scripts/maintain-tests.js` periodically (or via cron) to maintain optimization.
