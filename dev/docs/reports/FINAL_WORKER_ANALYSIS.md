# Final Worker Analysis - What We Actually Tested

## Tests We Actually Ran

### 1. Quick Parallel Tests (10 tests)
- **Finding**: Capped at 10 workers regardless of request
- 12, 15, 18 workers → All used only 10 workers
- Times: ~16-18s (variance due to system load)

### 2. Final Fixed Tests (12 tests)  
- **Finding**: Capped at 12 workers regardless of request
- 12, 15, 18 workers → All used only 12 workers
- Times: ~20-30s (2 tests consistently failing)

### 3. Parallel Test Suite (15 tests × 5 browsers = 75 total)
- With all browsers: Instant failure (missing Firefox/WebKit)
- With --project=chromium: Only 15 tests
- **Never successfully tested 12 vs 18 workers on this**

## What We Didn't Test Properly

**The 75-test scenario with 12-18 workers** because:
1. Missing browsers caused instant failures
2. When limited to Chromium, only 15 tests remained
3. 15 tests = capped at 15 workers anyway

## The Theoretical Analysis (Not Tested)

For a true 75-test suite:

| Workers | Tests/Worker | Batches | Expected Time |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 12 | 6.25 | 7 | Baseline |
| 15 | 5.0 | 5 | ~30% faster |
| 18 | 4.17 | 5 | ~30% faster |

## What We Learned Instead

1. **Playwright's smart capping** prevents over-allocation
2. **With 100 workers**: System meltdown (tested)
3. **With 10 workers**: Optimal for small test suites (tested)
4. **Missing browsers**: Major pain point

## The Honest Truth

**We never actually compared 12 vs 18 workers on a large test suite!**

All our tests were capped by test count:
- 10 tests → max 10 workers
- 12 tests → max 12 workers  
- 15 tests → max 15 workers

To properly test 12 vs 18 workers, we'd need:
- A suite with 20+ tests
- All running on same browser
- No artificial delays

## Conclusion

Our testing proved:
- ✅ 10 workers optimal for 10-12 tests
- ✅ 100 workers causes system failure
- ✅ Playwright caps at test count
- ❌ Never tested 12 vs 18 on large suite

The 12-18 worker comparison remains theoretical!
