# Dev Files Recovered from Backup ✅

## You Were Right! We Were Missing Many Files

### What Was Missing:
1. **15 Fix Scripts** - All the scripts that fixed various issues
2. **Additional Debug Tools** - Some debugging scripts weren't moved
3. **12 Test HTML Pages** - Component test pages
4. **2 Shell Scripts** - setup-remote.sh and claude-with-timeout.sh

### What I Recovered:

#### 1. **Fix Scripts** → `dev/scripts/fixes/` (15 files)
- `fix-markdown-complete.js` - Complete markdown parser fix
- `fix-markdown-parsing.js` - Parsing fixes
- `fix-missing-sections.js` - Section restoration
- `run-copy-button-tests.js` - Test runner
- `copy-button-fix.js` - Copy button implementation
- `fix-section-rendering.js` - Rendering fixes
- `patch-html.js` - HTML patching
- `add-render-section.js` - Section rendering
- And 7 more fix scripts...

#### 2. **Test Pages** → `dev/tests/fixtures/` (12 files)
- `test-functionality.html`
- `test-markdown-rendering.html`
- `test-typing-animation.html`
- `test-tooltips.html`
- `test_quiz.html`
- `test_fab.html`
- And 6 more test pages...

#### 3. **Shell Scripts** → `dev/scripts/` (2 additional)
- `setup-remote.sh` - Git setup script
- `claude-with-timeout.sh` - Extended timeout script

### Current Dev Structure:
```
dev/
├── scripts/
│   ├── fixes/          # 15 fix scripts (NOW COMPLETE!)
│   ├── *.sh           # 8 shell scripts
├── tests/
│   ├── tools/         # 34 testing utilities
│   ├── fixtures/      # 13 test HTML pages
│   └── playwright/    # Test specs
└── docs/              # Documentation
```

## Summary
You were absolutely right - we were missing significant development files! The backup contained:
- All the fix scripts that solved various issues during development
- Test pages for component testing
- Additional debugging tools
- Setup and utility scripts

These are now properly recovered and organized in the `dev/` directory where they belong.
