## Role Overview

As a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer specializing in Pulumi with TypeScript, you will design, deploy, and manage scalable cloud infrastructure using Pulumi's modern Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platform. Drawing on your expertise in TypeScript and the Pulumi SDK, you will develop reusable infrastructure components, automate deployments, and manage stack lifecycles across multiple cloud environments.

You will collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate infrastructure requirements into robust, maintainable Pulumi projects, ensuring best practices in modularity and automation. Your responsibilities will also include troubleshooting deployment issues, optimizing stack state management, and integrating infrastructure workflows into CI pipelines to support fast, reliable delivery of infrastructure changes.

## Responsibilities

• Design, develop, and maintain cloud infrastructure as code using Pulumi with TypeScript.
• Create reusable TypeScript abstractions and components for infrastructure resources.
• Manage infrastructure deployments and lifecycle using Pulumi CLI commands (pulumi up, preview, destroy).
• Handle stack state management and retrieve stack outputs for integration with applications and workflows.
• Write and maintain Jest or Mocha tests for infrastructure code to ensure quality and reliability.
• Troubleshoot and debug deployment issues using logs and Pulumi diagnostics tools.
• Collaborate with DevOps and engineering teams to continuously improve infrastructure code and automation pipelines.

## Requirements

• Proficiency in Pulumi using the TypeScript SDK.
• Strong skills in writing infrastructure code and abstractions with TypeScript.
• Experience with Pulumi CLI commands such as pulumi up, pulumi preview, and pulumi destroy.
• Understanding of Pulumi stack states and outputs management.
• Experience writing unit and integration tests using TypeScript testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
• Ability to debug infrastructure code and deployments using TypeScript and Pulumi tools.
