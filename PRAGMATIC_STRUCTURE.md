## What Actually Works

### The Good
- ✅ `index.html` has ALL interview content
- ✅ Search, dark mode, copy buttons all work
- ✅ Loads instantly, works offline
- ✅ Has your real experience and examples

### The Bad
- ❌ 3000 lines in one file
- ❌ Can't update content easily  
- ❌ Fixes are patched on top
- ❌ Not maintainable long-term

### The Reality
- 🤷 It's a prototype that works
- 🤷 Good enough for interview prep
- 🤷 Would need complete rewrite to fix properly

## Pragmatic Recommendations

### For Interview Prep (NOW)
1. Use `index.html` - it works
2. Ignore everything else
3. Focus on the content, not the code

### For Future Development
1. **Don't fix this** - start fresh
2. Build properly with:
   - React/Vue components
   - Markdown files for content
   - Proper build process
   - Content management

### What to Keep
- `index.html` - the working file
- `src/markdown/` - the original content
- Maybe `dev/tests/` - shows what was tested

### What to Delete
- `archive/` - 170MB of test junk
- Most `.md` files - just documentation of chaos
- Old analysis reports

## Bottom Line

This repo is a **working prototype** dressed up as a project. 

For interview prep: **It works perfectly.**
For software engineering: **It's a cautionary tale.**

Use the HTML file, ace your interview, then build something better.
