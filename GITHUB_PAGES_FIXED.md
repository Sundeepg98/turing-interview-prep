# GitHub Pages Hosting Fixed ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Personal Documents** 🔒
- Deleted `documents/` directory containing:
  - Your personal resume
  - Job description PDF
- These were publicly accessible - now removed for privacy!

### 2. **Single index.html** 
- Merged the better version from `dist/` (with mobile fixes) to root
- Deleted `dist/` directory to avoid confusion
- Now only ONE index.html at: `https://sundeepg98.github.io/turing-interview-prep/`

### 3. **Fixed npm Commands**
- Moved `package.json` from `dev/docs/analysis/` to root
- Now `npm test` and `npm start` will work properly

### 4. **Cleaned Temporary Files**
- Removed `playwright-report/` (already in .gitignore)
- Removed `test-results/` (already in .gitignore)

## Current Clean Structure

```

├── dev/                # Development workspace
└── archive/            # Historical data
```
