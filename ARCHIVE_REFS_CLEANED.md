# Archive References Cleaned ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. **Updated Configuration Files**
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Changed to ignore entire archive/ as optional
- ✅ `package.json` - Renamed `test:archive` → `test:cleanup`
- ✅ `playwright.config.js` - Already updated to use dev/test-output

### 2. **Updated Scripts**
- ✅ `maintain-tests.js` - Changed all "archive" → "backup" terminology
- ✅ `compress-traces.js` - Changed ARCHIVE_DIR → BACKUP_DIR
- ✅ All functions renamed (archiveTestResults → backupTestResults, etc.)

### 3. **Updated Documentation**
- ✅ `README.md` - Shows archive as optional
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Updated to show dev/ structure and test:cleanup

### 4. **Removed Outdated Files**
- ✅ Deleted `dev/docs/analysis/package.json` with old archive paths

### 5. **Remaining References**
Only 17 references left in JSON test output files:
- `dev/docs/analysis/test-output.json`
- `dev/docs/analysis/full-output.json`

These are just historical test results, not active code.

## Result

The keyword "archive" has been largely eliminated from active code:
- No more in scripts (uses "backup" instead)
- No more in configs (uses dev/ paths)
- No more in documentation (shows as optional)

The repository no longer depends on or emphasizes the archive directory!
